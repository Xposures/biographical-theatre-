							<h2>Task 4</h2>

						<p>Jakob was playing Bennet's older brother and the two of them were talking about 
                            their plans for the future. Jakob as Bennet's older brother seemed to have it all 
                            figured out while Bennet on the other hand was very insecure of his plans for the 
                            future. For the next part of the medley Bennet and Leyla were on stage. Leyla told 
                            Bennet about her big plans for her future. She also told him how she was very 
                            insecure about telling her parents because she was unsure if her parents would 
                            support her plans.

                            In my opinion both parts of the medley were highly relatable because especially 
                            at our age, it is difficult for most people to decide on a path. On the one hand 
                            because of the general uncertainty in these difficult times, but above all out of 
                            fear of little support from parents, as in Leyla's example.  </p>
