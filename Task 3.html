                        <br/>
						<p>My younger self is proud of what we have become. Especially that we are so much 
                            more confident today than we ever were as a kid. Also my younger self is 
                            pleasantly surprised that Mika and I are still friends and that so much more great 
                            friends are supporting us and chose to walk a part of their way alongside ours. 
                            Younger me is also very proud of the healthy way we deal with problems these days.
                            <br/> 
                            The younger version of myself likes the present version of myself very much and is 
                            convinced that there is a lot of good coming our way.

                        <h3>What is your imagination of a perfect home and where?</h3>

                        <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/fulls/perfect home.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                            My imagination of a perfect home is a spacious apartment in an old building with 
                            large windows, squeaky wooden floors and high ceilings. The walls are full of 
                            pictures and paintings. There are plants everywhere and cute little reminders 
                            of all the countries I've been to. The apartment is located in Cologne with an 
                            amazing view of the Rhine. </p>
