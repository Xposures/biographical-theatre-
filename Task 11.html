						<p>I had a lot of fun working with my own biography and biographical theater and I 
                            also learned a couple of things about myself and my classmates. 
                            I also think it was great that everyone was able to develop their own scene for 
                            this topic. This allowed me to be much more creative and bring my own biography to 
                            the stage exactly as I imagined it. 
                            I was also able to gain a lot of clarity about myself and my life through the 
                            intensive examination of myself and my biography. 
                            The many tasks about our pasts in particular reminded me of what a mostly 
                            beautiful childhood I had, but also helped me to look positively into the future.
