                        <h3>Version one</h3>
						<p>Basically the same scene as before but this time instead of uncomfortable noise sad 
                            music is playing in the background. This further supports the sad atmosphere that 
                            is created and includes the aspect of Music into my scene.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <h3>Version two</h3>
                        <p>In this version of my scene instead of negative thoughts, situations and feelings 
                            there are memories in general hanging from the ceiling. This brings the focus back 
                            to the original idea of biographical theatre. And instead of crumpling up the 
                            paper and throwing it away I walk through the signs explaining the and then I 
                            connect strings from the sign to myself forming a net of memories. 
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            To include a theatrical device that we discussed in class today I will explain the 
                            different stories with different volumes of my voice. This will give the audience 
                            a better understanding for the emotion connected to that story. For example if I 
                            talk in a quiet and calm way this suggests that the story is rather sad. If I on 
                            the other hand talk in a loud and powerful way the audience gets that this is a 
                            story I am proud of etc.</p>
