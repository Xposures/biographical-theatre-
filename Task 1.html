                        <h3>Writing</h3>
						<p>My childhood, my teenage years and my life overall can be described as somewhat 
                            challenging. With my parents divorce the COVID pandemic and other difficult 
                            situations. <br/> Until two years ago I had no good way to deal with these kinds of 
                            situations. That was until I started writing. <br/> I bought a small black journal and 
                            started writing in it whenever something happened in my life. No matter how small 
                            it seemed. <br/> This helped me a lot throughout the years and that is why writing is 
                            such an important aspect of my life. <br/><br/> To this day I wrote several short stories 
                            and poems.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <h3>My own room</h3>
                        <p>The privilege to have an own room is something I am extremely grateful for. 
                            Because ever since I was little my room was my safe space. A place where I 
                            could be myself. A place where I could do whatever I want and a place where 
                            thousands of great memories were forged. It never mattered where my room was 
                            located, at my Dad's or my Mom's. I always felt safe in my room.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <h3>My sister</h3>
                        <p>My sister and I always had a very close relationship. This may be because of our similar 
                            interests and our shared political engagement. 
                            I can always talk to them and they can always talk to me. 
                            So sometimes we just sit in my room and talk about what happend in our lives and I 
                            really value these conversations because I don't have to hide anything unlike with 
                            other people. Sometimes we even have telepathic conversations.
                        </p>
